A game turned into a Videogame :D

Project with two goals in mind:
<ol>
  <li>Using my newly acquired TDD knowledge</li>
  <li>Colaborating with someone</li>
</ol>

Now the last objective was more successfull as the first.
This project is overly complex and pretty much useless.

Now a 'lite' version of this game can be played on my
<a href='https://www.rok-klancar.com'>website</a>. If you
want to see the whole project up and running, I can do it
in one day.
